# Pre-Deployment Verification

## Deployment Target
$ARGUMENTS

Default: Production (Railway + Vercel)

---

## Phase 1: Preparation

```
think about deployment context:

1. What has changed since last deployment?
2. Are there database migrations to apply?
3. Are there new environment variables?
4. Is this a hotfix or regular release?
```

### Gather Deployment Info

```bash
# Current branch
git branch --show-current

# Changes since last deploy (compare with main)
git log main..HEAD --oneline

# Files changed
git diff main --name-only
```

**Document in thinking log.**

---

## Phase 2: Run Full Agent Suite

### 2.1 Quality Assurance

Call @qa-agent:

```
Full QA review for deployment:
- Branch: {current branch}
- Target: {production/staging}
- Focus: All changes since last deploy
```

**Must pass before continuing.**

### 2.2 API Synchronization

Call @api-sync-agent:

```
Verify API sync for deployment:
- Check all endpoints
- Verify request/response types
- Confirm error handling
```

**Must show IN_SYNC before continuing.**

### 2.3 Hebrew Validation

Call @hebrew-validator:

```
Validate all query-related code for Hebrew:
- Query generation endpoints
- Framework data handling
- Response content
```

**Must show CLEAN before continuing.**

### 2.4 Documentation Currency

Call @docs-agent:

```
Verify documentation is current:
- CLAUDE.md matches code
- Recent Changes Log updated
- API Reference accurate
```

---

## Phase 3: Build Verification

### 3.1 Backend Build Test

```bash
cd backend

# Syntax check all Python files
find . -name "*.py" -exec python -m py_compile {} \;

# Check for common issues
grep -r "DEBUG = True" . --include="*.py" && echo "⚠️ DEBUG=True found!"
grep -r "localhost" . --include="*.py" | grep -v "# " | grep -v "0.0.0.0"

# Verify Dockerfile
cat Dockerfile
docker build -t medai-hub-backend-test . 2>&1 | tail -20
```

### 3.2 Frontend Build Test

```bash
cd frontend

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Production build
npm run build

# Check for issues
grep -r "localhost" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v node_modules
grep -r "console.log" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v node_modules
```

---

## Phase 4: Environment Verification

### 4.1 Backend Environment Variables

**Required in Railway:**

```
Variable                    Status    Notes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
GOOGLE_API_KEY             [ ]       Required, AI service
SUPABASE_URL               [ ]       Required, database
SUPABASE_KEY               [ ]       Required, anon key  
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY  [ ]       Required, NO SPACES!
DEBUG                      [ ]       Must be False
```

**Verification:**
```python
# Check config.py defaults
# DEBUG should default to False
# No hardcoded keys
```

### 4.2 Frontend Environment Variables

**Required in Vercel:**

```
Variable                        Status    Notes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL            [ ]       https://api.shaitamam.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL       [ ]       Supabase project URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  [ ]       Supabase anon key
```

---

## Phase 5: Database Verification

### 5.1 Schema Check

```bash
# Compare local schema with docs
cat docs/schema.sql
```

### 5.2 Migration Status

```
Check:
- [ ] All migrations in docs/migrations/ have been applied
- [ ] Schema matches production
- [ ] No pending migrations
```

### 5.3 Data Integrity

```
Check:
- [ ] Foreign key constraints valid
- [ ] Required indexes exist
- [ ] No orphaned records (if possible to check)
```

---

## Phase 6: Full Deployment Checker

Call @deploy-checker:

```
Run complete deployment readiness check:
- Environment: production
- Backend: Railway
- Frontend: Vercel
- Database: Supabase
```

**Review report and address any issues.**

---

## Phase 7: Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Mandatory (All Must Pass)

```
Backend:
- [ ] Python syntax check passes
- [ ] No DEBUG=True in production code
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Dockerfile builds successfully
- [ ] Health endpoint exists and works
- [ ] CORS allows production frontend domain

Frontend:
- [ ] TypeScript check passes
- [ ] Production build succeeds
- [ ] No localhost URLs
- [ ] API URL from environment variable

Database:
- [ ] Schema is current
- [ ] Migrations applied
- [ ] Indexes exist

Integration:
- [ ] @api-sync-agent shows IN_SYNC
- [ ] @qa-agent shows APPROVED
- [ ] @hebrew-validator shows CLEAN

```

### Recommended (Should Pass)

```

- [ ] No print() in backend (use logging)
- [ ] All new endpoints documented
- [ ] Test coverage maintained
```

---

## Phase 8: Deployment Decision

### GO Decision

All mandatory checks pass. Proceed with deployment.

```
Deployment Plan:
1. Merge to main/develop
2. Railway auto-deploys backend
3. Vercel auto-deploys frontend
4. Verify health endpoints
5. Test key user flows
6. Monitor for errors
```

### NO-GO Decision

Some checks failed. Address issues.

```
Blocking Issues:
1. {Issue 1} - {How to fix}
2. {Issue 2} - {How to fix}

Action:
- Fix issues
- Re-run /project:pre-deploy
```

---

## Phase 9: Deployment Execution

If GO decision:

### 9.1 Merge

```bash
# Ensure up to date
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# If feature branch, merge
git merge feature/{name}

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin develop

# For production
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```

### 9.2 Monitor Deployment

```
Railway:
- Watch build logs
- Verify deployment completes
- Check health endpoint: https://api.shaitamam.com/health

Vercel:
- Watch build logs
- Verify deployment completes
- Check site loads: https://shaitamam.com
```

### 9.3 Post-Deployment Verification

```
Test critical flows:
1. [ ] Homepage loads
2. [ ] Login works
3. [ ] Create project works
4. [ ] Define tool chat works
5. [ ] Query generation works
6. [ ] File upload works (if changed)
```

---

## Phase 10: Rollback Plan

If issues occur post-deployment:

### Railway Rollback

```
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select medai-hub-backend service
3. Go to Deployments
4. Click "Rollback" on previous working deployment
```

### Vercel Rollback

```
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Select medai-hub project
3. Go to Deployments
4. Click "..." on previous deployment
5. Select "Promote to Production"
```

### Database Rollback (if migration was applied)

```
1. Run rollback script: docs/migrations/{date}_{name}_rollback.sql
2. Verify data integrity
3. Update schema.sql to previous state
```
